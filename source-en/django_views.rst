Rendering websites
==================

Entering the main address http://localhost:8000/ still displays an ugly error page. It can not be like 
that!

It's good to start working on a new website after preparing a plan of URLs (addresses). We know we 
will want to see a list of all the questionnaires on the site, let users vote and display the 
aggregated results of the questionnaire.

Let's open the file ``urls.py`` again and add four new entries. Eventually the file should look as follows::

  from django.conf.urls import patterns, include, url

  from django.contrib import admin
  admin.autodiscover()

  urlpatterns = patterns('',
      url(r'^polls/$', 'polls.views.index'),
      url(r'^polls/(?P<poll_id>\d+)/$', 'polls.views.detail'),
      url(r'^polls/(?P<poll_id>\d+)/results/$', 'polls.views.results'),
      url(r'^polls/(?P<poll_id>\d+)/vote/$', 'polls.views.vote'),
      url(r'^admin/', include(admin.site.urls)),
  )

Let's look at this example again. Each argument passed to the function ``patterns`` (except for the first one, but more on that later) determines our pattern URL (address). This pattern is written using a `regular expression <http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyra%C5%BCenie_regularne#Wyra.C5.BCenia_regularne_w_praktyce>`_. This is a difficult technical term for a tiny language used for 
concise representation of text patterns.


When a user tries to enter a specific address on our website, such as: http://localhost:8000/polls/1/,
Django selects the third part of the URL after the slash (in this case, ``polls/1/``) and tries to turn it subsequently into a regular expression to match the ``urlpatterns``. Let's look at an example of such expressions::

  r'^polls/(?P<poll_id>\d+)/vote/$'

This is a normal string (maybe except for the initial ``r``, which is used here only for
convenience). When we try to adjust the text to the string (we still think of ``polls/1/``), we need 
to remember the following:

.. admonition:: Regular expressions:
   :class: alert alert-info

   * Each letter and number of the regular expression applies to the same letter / number of the adjusted string. The same with the
     slash (``/``), space (``' '`` ), the underscore (``_``) and hyphen (``-``).
   * ``^`` applies only to the beginning of the string (“the beginning” is here an abstract symbol 
     before the first character)
   * ``$`` matches only the end of the string (in a similar way as “the beginning”).
   * The dot (``.``) matches any character.
   * If several characters are put in the square brackets, like this: ``[abde]``, the group counts as 
     one unit and will match any of the characters within the group.
   * There is an abbreviated notation for such groups. Rather than write all the small letters of the
     alphabet, we can write ``[a-z]`` to match any single lowercase letter. Same for the upper case letters ``[A-Z]`` or digits ``[0-9]``.
   * Matching one number can be even shorter by using the stamp ``\d``.
   * If after any of the above expressions we put the sign ``?`` it will be treated as optional. This 
     means that if in the matched string there is no such an expression it will still be possible to match it. If it exits, it will be matched.
   * If we put ``*`` after the expression it will match with any number of repetitions, except for a 
     zero of repetitions, that is to say, as if it was optional.
   * If we put ``+`` after the expression it will match with any number of repetitions, except for a 
     zero repetitions (the expression must occur at least once).
   * If several characters are put in regular brackets, such as ``(\d \d)`` they will be treated as a 
     group and all of these modifiers will work with the whole group of characters. If you also write it with ``(? P <NAME> string)``, the group can be later called as NAME. It is very popular while working with Django.

Phew ... There are many rules, but no one really can remember them all. The above is sufficient in 
most cases.

Do you see already that the sample phrase matches the ``polls/1/?`` Why?

Once Django finds a match it will look at the second part of the line. It defines the view, which is 
called to create the site for the user. For ``polls/1/`` it will be ``polls.views.detail``. All named 
groups will be transferred to the view as arguments of the same name.

First view
----------

Ok, let's see how it works in practice. Unfortunately, entering the address
http://localhost:8000/polls/1/ does not end well::

  ViewDoesNotExist at /polls/1/

  Could not import polls.views.detail. View does not exist in module polls.views.

This is because we have not defined the view yet (Django tells us that was looking for ``polls.views.
detail``, unfortunately without any success).

Let’s open the file in the ``polls/views.py`` and add a few new features::

    from django.http import HttpResponse

    def index(request):
        return HttpResponse("Hello, world. You're at the poll index.")

    def detail(request, poll_id):
        return HttpResponse("You're looking at poll %s." % poll_id)

    def results(request, poll_id):
        return HttpResponse("You're looking at the results of poll %s." % poll_id)

    def vote(request, poll_id):
        return HttpResponse("You're voting on poll %s." % poll_id)

These are the simplest possible views. They do not return regular strings, such as the function which 
builds the Christmas tree in Python, because they have to speak HTTP protocol, which is a bit more 
complicated (Here it would be interesting to see in a browser, what's going on when you enter the 
address http://localhost:8000/polls/1/).


View that really does something
-------------------------------

For now our views don’t do much. Let's give them some work!

Everything Django needs from the view is a
`HttpResponse <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/ref/request-response/#django.http.HttpResponse>`_
object or a thrown exception. All the rest is under our control. For example, we can use the functions that we learned in the interactive mode to display all the polls for the user.


At the beginning of the ``polls/views.py`` file append::

    from django.http import HttpResponse
    from polls.models import Poll

Expand function ``index`` to look as below:

.. code-block:: python

  def index(request):
      latest_poll_list = Poll.objects.all().order_by('-pub_date')[:5]
      output = ', '.join([p.question for p in latest_poll_list])
      return HttpResponse(output)

.. note::

    Now we do not give the entire content of the file as it would be too long. Only the most important changes should be reported.

It works! There is only one problem with this example: we define in the view not only what has to be 
returned, but also in what format it should be returned to the site user. One of the most important 
skills of a programmer is the ability to distinguish and divide the two independent things. 

Django programmers thought about it and decided to create a system of templates:

At the beginning of the ``polls/views.py`` file append::

  from django.template import Context, loader

That will let us to use template system.

In the same file expand function ``index`` to look as below::

  def index(request):
      latest_poll_list = Poll.objects.all().order_by('-pub_date')[:5]
      t = loader.get_template('polls/index.html')
      c = Context({
          'latest_poll_list': latest_poll_list,
      })
      return HttpResponse(t.render(c))

The functions: ``get_template`` (it finds a template) and ``render`` (it changes the template into a text 
will be finally delivered to the user) are responsible for our template handling.

The code is a bit longer, but we will see soon that everything is much more clear. However, first 
let’s load the page http://localhost:8000/polls/ to see the result of our work::

  TemplateDoesNotExist at /polls/
  polls/index.html

Oops! Well, we still haven’t added the template. To do this, let's create a file ``polls/templates/polls/index.html`` and add to it:

.. code-block:: django

  {% if latest_poll_list %}
  <ul>
      {% for poll in latest_poll_list %}
          <li><a href="/polls/{{ poll.id }}/">{{ poll.question }}</a></li>
      {% endfor %}
  </ul>
  {% else %}
      <p>No polls are available.</p>
  {% endif %}

.. note::
    Application ``templates`` are located in the directory ``templates of applications`` and the function get_template searches templates in these directories, that is why we didn’t have to give the entire path ``polls/templates/polls/index.html``, ``polls/index.html.`` was enough.

When you reload the page in a browser you should see a list of all the polls created earlier.

.. note::

    If you refresh the page and you still see an error, you must restart the server. In the console where the server is running press ``Ctrl + C`` and execute ``python manage.py runserver`` again. It should work now.

.. note::

   HTML and CSS are the formats that define the appearance of web pages. We will use Django templates to generate the HTML code. A good description of HTML is in the book
   `Interactive Data Visualization for the Web <http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/index.html>`_.
   The incredible characteristics of the Web is that HTML and CSS codes of every site are public. We recommend to watch the code of your favorite sites.

Almost in every view you will need eventually to use a template. Therefore, in Django there is a 
function ``render`` which allows you to do this in a shorter way:

Please correct beginning of the file ``polls/views.py`` to looks as below::

  from django.shortcuts import render
  from polls.models import Poll

Please correct ``index`` function to looks as below::

  def index(request):
      latest_poll_list = Poll.objects.all().order_by('-pub_date')[:5]
      return render(
          request,
          'polls/index.html',
          {'latest_poll_list': latest_poll_list})


Returning 404 code
------------------

Now let’s focus on the view of the poll details – a site which displays questions from a defined 
questionnaire.

At the beginning of the ``polls/views.py`` file append::

    from django.http import Http404

``Http404`` is an exception shared by Django. We can use this exception in case our aplication can’t 
found a poll desired by user (by writing ``raise Http404``). As a result browser will show the error 
404 page.


.. note::

   You can change the page displayed by Django in case of the error 404 (the page does not exist) and 500 (unexpected server error). To do this, you need to create templates ``404.html`` and ``500.html``. Before checking if it works, change ``DEBUG`` in the ``settings.py`` file to ``False``. Otherwise, Django will continue to display its auxiliary yellow pages.

PChange ``detail`` function as below::

    def detail(request, poll_id):
        try:
            p = Poll.objects.get(id=poll_id)
        except Poll.DoesNotExist:
            raise Http404
        return render(request, 'polls/detail.html', {'poll': p})

Then create ``polls/templates/polls/detail.html`` file with content as below:

.. code-block:: django

    <h1>{{ poll.question }}</h1>
    <ul>
    {% for choice in poll.choice_set.all %}
        <li>{{ choice.choice_text }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>


Form management
---------------

Let's change the template ``polls/templates/polls/details.html``, by adding a simple HTML form.

Change ``polls/templates/polls/details.html`` file as below:

.. code-block:: django

  <h1>{{ poll.question }}</h1>

  {% if error_message %}<p><strong>{{ error_message }}</strong></p>{% endif %}

  <form action="/polls/{{ poll.id }}/vote/" method="post">
  {% csrf_token %}
  {% for choice in poll.choice_set.all %}
      <input type="radio" name="choice" id="choice{{ forloop.counter }}" value="{{ choice.id }}" />
      <label for="choice{{ forloop.counter }}">{{ choice.choice_text }}</label><br />
  {% endfor %}
  <input type="submit" value="Vote" />
  </form>

.. note::

   ``{% csrf_token %}``  is a very magical way to protect websites from new forms of attack on websites users. More information in the documentation
   `documentation Cross Site Request Forgery <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/ref/contrib/csrf/>`_.

Attentive reader will note that form is send to ``/polls/{{ poll.id }}/vote/`` adress, which does not 
support data from forms yet. Now we will add forms' support. 

At the beginning of the ``polls/views.py`` file append::

    from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect
    from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse
    from django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404
    from polls.models import Choice

Correct ``vote`` function, as below::

    def vote(request, poll_id):
        p = get_object_or_404(Poll, id=poll_id)
        try:
            selected_choice = p.choice_set.get(id=request.POST['choice'])
        except (KeyError, Choice.DoesNotExist):
            # If user would choose the wrong option, show error
            return render(request, 'polls/detail.html', {
                'poll': p,
                'error_message': "You have to choose correct option.",
            })

        # Save the new number of votes
        selected_choice.votes += 1
        selected_choice.save()
        # Redirect a user to poll detail view, on which he or she just voted.  
       return HttpResponseRedirect(reverse('polls.views.results', args=(p.id,)))

In the view there are a lot of new ideas here which we have not discussed yet.

The ``request`` object contains the data sent by the user and ``request.POST`` contains the form data sent by the user. In this way we know which option was selected.

Here comes the important question. It may turn out that the view received a nonexistent answer. We 
always have to check the data received from the user and respond to a situation when the data has no 
sense. This is what happens in the :keyword:`except`clause. Then we redirect the user to the 
questionnaire and display the error.

If the user selects the correct option, we can increase the number of votes and save the changes. Then
we make a redirection by using ``HttpResponseRedirect`` to the previously written view of the details 
of questionnaire.

Another important issue: after voting we could just display the page, like at the end of the view of 
details (by using render). Unfortunately this could lead to the resending of the questionnaire. If the 
user starts playing with the back and forward buttons in the browser, or just refreshes the page (by 
pressing F5) In short, always after the correct form is submitted (in this case, voting for a poll), 
we should perform a redirection by using HttpResponseRedirect.

At the end we still have to develop a view of the poll results, displayed after voting.

Correct ``results function``, as below::

  def results(request, poll_id):
      p = get_object_or_404(Poll, id=poll_id)
      return render(request, 'polls/results.html', {'poll': p})

And create ``polls/templates/polls/results.html`` file, with the following content:

.. code-block:: django

  <h1>{{ poll.question }}</h1>

  <ul>
  {% for choice in poll.choice_set.all %}
      <li>{{ choice.choice_text }} -- {{ choice.votes }} vote{{ choice.votes|pluralize }}</li>
  {% endfor %}
  </ul>

  <a href="/polls/{{ poll.id }}/">Vote again?</a>

That's it! Enter the address http://localhost:8000/admin/ and create several new polls and questions. 
Then play with voting them and invite others to do the same.
