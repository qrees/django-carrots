Django Carrots Manual
=====================

We present you a manual to learn Python and Django. Even if you cannot program yet, by following the manual and doing all the exercises you should be able to create your own website.

The manual is a part of the workshop Django Carrots organized by Geek Girls Carrots. You can use it to organize your own workshops or for self-study.
If you decide to use the manual, we would be grateful if you contact us (however it is optional).
